# VagrantBoxDownloader
VagrantBoxDownloader is a Python script that allows you to download Vagrant boxes from the Vagrant cloud ("https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?provider=virtualbox") using web scraping (beautiful soup4 library). It helps you quickly fetch Vagrant boxes and save them locally for offline use or personal development projects.
By default, it just downloads the box that Virtualbox is set as the provider. and it creates the box file in this format " <box-name>.<version>.box " and then creates all of your box's download links as a TxT file! you can modify the script to download the box of your choice! (eg. libvirt, lxc)
